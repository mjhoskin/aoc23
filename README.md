# Advent of Code 2023

Last year was written in GSQL, TigerGraph's proprietary graph language. This year is written in cypher, primarily used by Neo4j, and widely adopted. 

Solutions will include daily cypher files, containing just the raw cypher, and wrapper python files, which will include code for importing, hitting endpoints. Python processing of the input will be minimised. 

My cypher knowledge is quite low, so this will probably not be a lesson in good practice, rather, an opportunity for me to try and upskill.
